        <u><h3> Complaints</h3></u>
In this practice we take complaints very seriously indeed and try to ensure
that all our patients are pleased with their experience of our service. When
patients complain, they are dealt with courteously and promptly so that the
matter is resolved as quickly as possible. This procedure is based on these
objectives.
Our aim is to react to complaints in the way in which we would want our
complaint about a service to be handled.
We learn from every mistake that we make and we respond to customers'
concerns in a caring and sensitive way.
        <br>
1. The person responsible for dealing with any complaint about the service
which we provide is the Practice Manager.
        <br>
2. If a patient complains on the telephone or at the reception desk, we will
listen to their complaint and offer to refer him or her to the Practice Manager
immediately. If the Practice manager is not available at the time, then the
patient will be told when they will be able to talk to the Practice Manager and
arrangements will be made for this to happen. The member of staff will take
brief details of the complaint and pass them on. If we cannot arrange this
within a reasonable period or if the patient does not wish to wait to discuss the
matter, arrangements will be made for someone else to deal with it.
        <br>
3. If the patient complains in writing the letter will be passed on immediately to
either the appropriate dentist or Practice Manager.
        <br>
4. If a complaint is about any aspect of clinical care or associated charges it
will normally be referred to the dentist, unless the patient does not want this to
happen.
        <br>
5. We will acknowledge the patient's complaint in writing and enclose a copy
of this code of practice as soon as possible, normally within three working
days. We will seek to investigate the complaint within ten working days of
receipt to give an explanation of the circumstances which led to the complaint.
If the patient does not wish to meet us, then we will attempt to talk to them on
the telephone. If we are unable to investigate the complaint within ten working
days we will notify the patient, giving reasons for the delay and a likely period
within which the investigation will be completed.
        <br>
6. We will confirm the decision about the complaint in writing immediately after
completing our investigation.
        <br>
7. Proper and comprehensive records are kept of any complaint received
