<h1>Bharam Sarovar</h1>
 <p align="centre">Brahma Sarovar is an ancient water tank sacred to Hinduism in Thanesar, in the state of Haryana in North India.Hinduism lays emphasis on taking bath for internal and external purity.
  Most religious sites have water tanks or sarovar in or near the temple/gurdwara.
   The Hindu genealogy registers at Kurukshetra, Haryana are kept here.</p>
  <br>
  <p align="centre">
  According to stories of myths, Lord Brahma created the universe from the land of Kurukshetra after a huge yajna. The Brahma Sarovar here is believed to be the cradle of civilization. The sarovar is also mentioned in the eleventh century AD memoirs of Al Beruni, called ‘Kitab-ul-Hind’. The sarovar also has a mention in Mahabharata citing its use by Duryodhana to hide himself under water on the concluding day of the war.
A sacred shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva stands within the sarovar, accessible by a small bridge. According to scriptures, bathing in this sarovar increases the sanctity of performing the ‘ashvamedh yajna’. The tank offers a breath-taking sight during the Gita Jayanti celebrations held in the last week of November and early December every year when there will be ‘deep daan’ and ‘aarti’. This also happens to be the time when migratory birds from distant places wing it to the sarovar. The Birla Gita Mandir and Baba Nath’s haveli and temple are the neighbouring attractions.

<h1>Jyotsar Tample</h1>
   <p align="centre">
     Jyotisar is a town on the Kurukshetra-Pehowa road, in the Kurukshetra district of Haryana, India. It is at this place where Krishna delivered the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna to remove his confusion and dilemma and prepared him to face stronger and greater warriors like Bhishma and Karna in the Mahabharata War.
The banyan tree under which the Bhagavad Gita was delivered still stands.

The sacred Banyan tree at Jyotisar.
'Jyoti' means light and 'Sar' means the core meaning. Hence the name of place is a reference to the 'core meaning of light' or ultimately of God. It is one of the most revered holy sites of the holy city of Kurukshetra. A Vat (Banyan tree) stands on a raised plinth. Local traditions say that this tree is an offshoot of the holy Banyan tree under which Lord Krishna delivered the sermon of Bhagavad Gita, the doctrine of Karma and Dharma to his wavering friend Arjuna. It is here that He showed his Virat rupa (Universal form).
A marble chariot depicting Krishna delivering the sermon to Arjuna marks the site of the Srimad Bhagwad Gita. In one secluded section of this center, an old Shiva temple can also be seen. Hundreds of years ago, a holy water tank was present here and it can still be seen in the rainy season. The Kurukshetra Development Board has renovated the site in recent times. A mango shaped lake has been constructed here with covered bathing ghats for ladies. Cement parapets and enclosures have been built for protection. A light and music show is organized by the tourism department at the site, on a regular basis, which recreates episodes from the epic Mahabharata. A restaurant and accommodation wing for pilgrims have been built and the entire area has been landscaped with flowering bushes and eucalyptus trees.
